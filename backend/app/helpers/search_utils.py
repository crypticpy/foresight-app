    Supabase / PostgREST's ``.ilike()`` does not escape wildcard chars, so a
    caller that interpolates raw user input into the pattern turns them into
    wildcards. ``q="%"`` (or ``q="*"``) would match every row; ``q="_"`` would
    match every single-character value.

    Characters escaped (with the default ``\\`` escape char so Postgres treats
    them literally):

    - ``\\`` — the escape char itself; must be escaped *first* so the
      backslashes we add below aren't themselves re-escaped.
    - ``%`` — LIKE "any string" wildcard.
    - ``_`` — LIKE "any single character" wildcard.
    - ``*`` — PostgREST accepts ``*`` as an alias for ``%`` inside ``ilike``
      filter values, so a bare ``q="*"`` would otherwise still match
      everything even after the other escapes. Escape it the same way.
