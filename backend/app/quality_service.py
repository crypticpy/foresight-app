"""
Source Quality Index (SQI) calculation service for Foresight.

Computes a composite quality score (0-100) for each card based on the
credibility, diversity, and freshness of its underlying sources.  The SQI
is designed to give decision-makers a quick, defensible signal about how
much weight to place on a card's claims.

Architecture
------------
The SQI is a weighted composite of five independent dimensions:

    SQI = (source_authority   * 0.30)
        + (source_diversity   * 0.20)
        + (corroboration      * 0.20)
        + (recency            * 0.15)
        + (municipal_specificity * 0.15)

Each dimension produces a sub-score in the range [0, 100].  The weighted
sum is rounded to the nearest integer and clamped to [0, 100].

Weight Rationale
----------------
- **Source Authority (30%)** receives the largest weight because the
  credibility of the originating domain (e.g., a Tier 1 research firm
  vs. an unknown blog) is the single strongest predictor of information
  reliability.

- **Source Diversity (20%)** rewards cards that draw from multiple
  *types* of sources (RSS, news API, academic, government, etc.).
  Cross-type corroboration is harder to fake and reduces single-source
  risk.

- **Corroboration (20%)** counts how many *independent stories* (via
  the story clustering service) back the card's claims.  Multiple
  clusters mean multiple editorial or research teams arrived at the
  same conclusion independently.

- **Recency (15%)** ensures that cards built on fresh evidence rank
  higher than those relying on dated material.  This is especially
  important for horizon scanning, where timeliness matters.

- **Municipal Specificity (15%)** captures how directly relevant the
  sources are to municipal government operations.  A .gov-domain
  bonus further lifts cards backed by official government publications.

Storage
-------
Results are persisted to two columns on the ``cards`` table:

- ``quality_score`` (INTEGER 0-100): the composite SQI.
- ``quality_breakdown`` (JSONB): the five sub-scores plus metadata::

    {
        "source_authority": 85,
        "source_diversity": 70,
        "corroboration": 50,
        "recency": 100,
        "municipal_specificity": 75,
        "calculated_at": "2025-02-10T12:00:00Z",
        "source_count": 5,
        "cluster_count": 3
    }

Dependencies
------------
- ``domain_reputation_service`` -- provides per-URL authority scores.
- ``story_clustering_service``  -- provides cluster counts for
  corroboration scoring.

    """
    Calculate the Source Authority sub-score (0-100).

    Measures the average credibility of the domains behind a card's sources
    using the domain reputation system.

    Algorithm
    ---------
    1. Collect all source URLs.
    2. Look up domain reputations in batch (uses in-memory cache for speed).
    3. Convert each reputation to a 0-100 authority score via
       ``domain_reputation_service.get_authority_score()``.
    4. Return the arithmetic mean, rounded to the nearest integer.

    Scoring examples
    ----------------
    - All Tier 1 domains (Gartner, McKinsey): ~85
    - Mix of Tier 1 and Tier 2: ~70
    - All unknown/untiered domains: ~20

    Calculate the Source Diversity sub-score (0-100).

    Measures how many distinct *types* of sources (API source categories)

    information channels (e.g., an RSS feed AND an academic paper AND a

    Retrieve the stored SQI breakdown for a card without recalculating.

    This is a lightweight read-only operation that simply fetches the
    ``quality_breakdown`` JSONB column from the ``cards`` table.  Use
    this when you need the breakdown for display or filtering but do
    not want to trigger a (potentially expensive) recalculation.

    -------
    Optional[dict]
