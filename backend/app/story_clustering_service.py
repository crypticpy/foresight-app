"""
Story clustering service for Foresight.

Groups sources that report on the same underlying event or story using
semantic similarity of their vector embeddings. This enables two key
capabilities in the Source Quality Index (SQI):

1. **Corroboration counting** -- When multiple independent sources cover
   the same story, the SQI corroboration component increases, reflecting
   higher confidence in the information.

2. **Deduplication** -- The discovery queue can show one representative
   per cluster instead of N near-duplicate articles.

Algorithm
---------
The clustering uses a greedy union-find approach with cosine similarity:

1. Fetch sources and their VECTOR(1536) embeddings from the database.
2. Sources without embeddings are each assigned their own unique cluster
   (they cannot be compared, so we conservatively treat them as distinct).
3. For sources with embeddings, compute pairwise cosine similarity.
4. If similarity >= 0.90, merge the two sources into the same cluster
   using a union-find (disjoint set) data structure.
5. Assign a fresh UUID as story_cluster_id for each disjoint set.
6. Persist the story_cluster_id back to the sources table.

Threshold choice (0.90)
-----------------------
A threshold of 0.90 is deliberately high to avoid false merges. At this
level, only sources discussing the *same specific event* (e.g., two
articles about the same city council vote) are grouped together. Broader
topical overlap (e.g., two articles about housing policy in general) will
NOT be merged, which is the desired behavior -- we want corroboration of
the same story, not topical similarity.

For reference, the card deduplication threshold in the discovery pipeline
is 0.92 (see discovery_service.py). The story clustering threshold is
slightly lower because sources within a card are already topically
related, so we expect higher baseline similarity.
