- Recent significant developments

## PEER CITY APPROACHES
- Which peer cities have implemented or piloted this (cite specific cities from the list above)
- What approaches or vendors did they use
- What outcomes or results have they reported
- Lessons learned from peer city implementations

## MUNICIPAL APPLICATIONS
- Specific use cases for city government

Important guidelines:
- Be SPECIFIC with examples, names, dates, and numbers where available
- Include PEER CITY examples where this has been implemented
- Map recommendations to SPECIFIC Austin departments and CMO priorities
- Make recommendations ACTIONABLE for city planners
- Note UNCERTAINTIES and knowledge gaps
- Keep the report between 2000-3000 words
- Use markdown formatting for readability
- When citing findings from the analyzed sources, reference them by their title in the text

SOURCE EVIDENCE ({source_count} sources):
{source_details}

Generate a profile with these sections (use markdown formatting):

## Overview
What this signal is, why it matters, and how it connects to broader trends. Provide context that helps a non-expert understand the significance. (2-3 paragraphs)

## Key Developments
Specific examples, data points, timelines, and evidence from the sources. Include names of organizations, programs, technologies, and cities involved. Be concrete — cite specific examples rather than making general statements.

## Municipal Relevance
How this signal specifically impacts city government operations, service delivery, budgets, or strategic planning. What departments or functions are most affected? Reference specific Austin strategic priorities where applicable.

## What to Watch
Key indicators that would signal acceleration or deceleration of this trend. Upcoming milestones, decision points, or events that the team should monitor. What would trigger a need for immediate action?

GUIDELINES:
- Write 500-800 words total
- Be SPECIFIC — use names, dates, numbers, and examples from the sources
- Write for a municipal government audience — city managers, department heads, elected officials
- Avoid jargon without explanation
- Each section should have substantive content, not just headers
- If sources are thin, acknowledge gaps rather than fabricating details
- Do NOT include a sources section — that is handled separately
