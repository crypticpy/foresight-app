"""
Signal Quality Score computation for Foresight cards.

Computes a 0-100 quality score based on data completeness and research depth.
The score reflects how well-sourced, researched, and validated a card is.

Scoring Components (weighted):
  - Source Count (15%): Number of sources linked to the card
  - Source Diversity (10%): Variety of source types and domains
  - Avg Credibility (15%): Average credibility rating from discovered sources
  - Avg Triage Confidence (10%): Average AI triage confidence
  - Deep Research (15%): Whether deep research has been performed
  - Research Tasks (10%): Number of completed research tasks
  - Entity Count (5%): Number of entities extracted
  - Human Review (10%): Whether the card has been reviewed by a human
  - Engagement (10%): Follows and workstream membership
